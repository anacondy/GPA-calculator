## Changes Made

### 1. Security Enhancements

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" 
      content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';">
```
- Prevents external script execution
- Protects against XSS attacks
- Restricts resource loading to same origin

#### Input Validation
- ✅ Prevents negative numbers
- ✅ Ensures obtained marks ≤ total marks
- ✅ Validates non-zero denominators
- ✅ Limits subject name to 50 characters
- ✅ User-friendly error alerts

#### XSS Protection
- ✅ Replaced `innerHTML` with safe `createElement()` and `textContent`
- ✅ All user input automatically escaped
- ✅ No `eval()` or dynamic code execution
- ✅ Tested against common XSS payloads

### 2. Code Quality Improvements

#### Removed Redundancy
- Deleted duplicate file `gpa_calculator_ui.html`
- Removed unnecessary sanitization function
- Simplified closure pattern using `bind()`

#### Modern JavaScript Patterns
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, const/let)
- Clean event handler binding
- Modular function design

#### Version Control
- Added `.gitignore` file
- Proper commit history
- Clear commit messages

### 3. Documentation Enhancements

#### README.md (3,467 bytes)
- Feature showcase with icons
- Security features section
- Getting started guide
- Grading system table
- Technical specifications
- Deployment instructions
- Changelog

#### SECURITY.md (1,402 bytes)
- Security features list
- Vulnerability reporting process
- User best practices
- Security update log

#### ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md (6,824 bytes)
- Comprehensive security analysis
- Code quality metrics
